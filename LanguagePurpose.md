### Language purpose/genesis
#### Swift
Apple began developing Swift in 2010 to serve as a safer, faster, and more concise replacement to Objective-C. Swift is used to create apps for Apple products. It was designed to give developers more freedom, to create code that is easier to read and maintain, and to save time by requiring less code to express more complex ideas. It introduced a system to help combat common programming errors, like null pointers.

#### Java
Java was released by Sun Microsystems in 1995 as a responce to C and C++ and was designed to follow five primary goals:
1. simple, object-oriented, and familiar
2. robust and secure
3. architecture-neutral and portable
4. execute with high prerformance
5. interpreted, threaded, and dynamic
