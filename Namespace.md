### Namespaces
#### Swift
Namespaces are implicit and not needed due to Swift Modules, as all class are explicitly scoped by the module. 

#### Java
In Java, namespaces are called packages and are implemented using the keyword `package`. A package contains a group of related classes and interfaces. The keyword `import` is used to access a class outside of a package.
```java
import java.util.Vector;
```
