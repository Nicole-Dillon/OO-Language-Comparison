### Procedural programming
#### Swift
Swift supports procedural programming. Unlike other programming languages, Swift does not require you to create separate interface and implementation files for custom classes and structures. In Swift, you define a class or a structure in a single file, and the external interface to that class or structure is automatically made available for other code to use.

#### Java
Java is able to support procedural programming even though it is an object oriented language.
