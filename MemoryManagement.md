### Memory management
#### Swift
Swift does not have garbage collection so it uses Automatic Reference Counting (ARC) to track and manage your app’s memory usage. In most cases, this means that memory management “just works” in Swift, and you do not need to think about memory management yourself. ARC automatically frees up the memory used by class instances when those instances are no longer needed.

#### Java
Java has garbage collection, which tracks all the objects and frees the memory if the program no longer references that object.
