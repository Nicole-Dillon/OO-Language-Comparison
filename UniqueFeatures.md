### Unique features of the language
#### Swift
Swift introduces optional types. Optionals handle the absense of value and state that there either is a value and what is is equal to, or there is no value at all.
```swift
//optional int that does not have a value
var optionalInt: Int? = nil
```
#### Java
Java runs on the Java Virtual Machine, thus making the Java code platform independent.
